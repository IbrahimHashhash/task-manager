# ðŸ”· Project Title:
Task Management System

## ðŸ”· Technologies Used:
**Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
**Backend**: PHP  
**Database**: MySQL

## ðŸ”· Purpose of the Project:
To create a web-based system that allows organizations to manage their projects, tasks, teams, and employee contributions efficiently.

## ðŸ”· Main Users (Roles):
- **Manager**  
- **Project Leader**  
- **Team Member**

Each role has different functionalities and permissions in the system.

## ðŸ”· Core Features:
### âœ… Authentication:
- Secure login system.
- Session-based role detection (Manager, Project Leader, Team Member).

### âœ… Project Management (Manager):
- Add new projects.
- Assign projects to project leaders.

### âœ… Task Management (Project Leader):
- Create tasks for assigned projects.
- Assign team members to tasks.
- Define contribution percentages (must not exceed 100%).

### âœ… Team Member Dashboard:
- View assigned tasks and their contribution.
- Submit task status updates.

## ðŸ”· Navigation System:
- Uses a single PHP file (`navigation.php`) that:
  - Detects role using sessions.
  - Dynamically includes role-specific pages (e.g., `create_task.php`, `assign_team_members.php`, etc.).
  - Uses query strings like `?action=create_task` to determine which component to show.

## ðŸ”· Data Validation & Logic Handling:
- Validates form input (e.g., total contribution should not exceed 100%).
- Ensures only appropriate roles can access specific actions.
- Feedback messages for errors and successes.

## ðŸ”· Design Philosophy:
- Role-based access and interfaces.
- Reusable and modular code.
- Navigation remains consistent while content dynamically changes.
